<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<h2>"Do It Now!" A collaborative productivity motivator!</h2>
<p>My Project Idea is for a mobile application and website called “Do It Now!” (Working Title).
It is a Productivity app that matches you with another random user (or a nominated friend) as a “productivity buddy”. The app will send you notifications, not for yourself, but for your buddy. It is then the user’s responsibility to motivate their buddy to do the tasks that they want to get done. There will be gamifying elements to the app like challenges, races and a points system with a leader board to encourage people to do the right thing in both helping their productivity buddy and completing their own tasks.
</p>
<p>The buddy system may seem at first like an unneeded extra step, but I believe having another real person to be accountable to brings a whole extra level of accountability to the app. Having a real person to answer to instead of just a regular notification makes it much harder to ignore.
</p>
<p>I can be a very lazy person, and I am not the only one. Lack of motivation and procrastination are huge problems for many people around the world and by turning the task that needs to be done into that app on your phone that you go to when you should be doing something else, people will be motivated to get things done.
</p>
<p>Gamifying Learning has been proven to increase learner engagement in schools and other learning facilities, Personalizing the learning and allowing creative thinking and problem solving (Wyman, 2020), so why not apply that to productivity. Users will be encouraged to be creative and think outside of the box when completing their tasks. Video Games can be addictive and in a world where people would rather squeeze in a game of Call of Duty with friends before bed instead of getting the dishes done, imagine what it could be like if doing the dishes was the game you were squeezing in.
The basic design of the app will be simple. The User Interface will be clean and not too cluttered, with light colours and large shapes. I want the app to be inviting and intuitive, with simple instructions.
</p>
<p>When the app is first opens, the user will be greeted by a quiz asking them what they need help with and how often they want to be encouraged, followed by a sign-up page to set up an account. The app will then ask if the user has a friend to nominate as a buddy and if so, they can enter their email address or username. If the user does not have a buddy to nominate, one is then randomly assigned.
</p>
<p>The user is then presented with a quick tour of the User Interface, showcasing how to change preferences and settings or to opt out of the partnership with their buddy. The main screen will then be like that of a messaging app, with a field at the bottom to type in to communicate with their buddy. At the top of your screen will be the user’s specific goal and under that is the goal of their buddy.
</p>
<p>Each day, or when ever their buddy has specified, the user receives a notification telling them their buddy needs help and the user is prompted to send a message. Upon receiving each message, the buddy can then rate the encouragement message and give feedback to the user about the approach and what works and what does not, as well as a regular reply. 
</p>
<p>Users receive points for each message sent and each task completed, which contribute to achievements or awards for that users account. These Points and Awards can be used in a built-in storefront to purchase decorations and other in app items to be shown on the user’s profile page. Users also have the option to share these things on social media and compete with friends on the app.
</p>
<p>The app will run on Android, iOS, iPadOS and have a desktop version either as a website or a desktop application. 
</p>
<p>Tools and technology required to build the app will be a computer to build it on as well as the necessary development kits for each platform. Also, the target devices themselves will be used for testing the final product. For Android development I will need the Android Studio application and the Android SDK running on my current Windows PC. For iOS and iPadOS I can get a Mac and use XCode to either rebuild the app from scratch or modify the code from the android version. Once an iOS version is completed, a desktop version for mac can easily be ported to macOS within Xcode. For the Desktop version for windows I will build a website with all the functionality of the Mobile App using HTML, CSS and Javascript and an applicable Integrated Development Environment (IDE). On top of all the technical and coding parts of creating the app I will also need to use applications such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to design the user interface and any logos or other assets needed for the project.
</p>
<p>To do all this I will need to learn many things including HTML, CSS and Javascript for the website, Java for the android and iOS versions, as well as familiarizing myself with specific software such as Apples Xcode. I will also need to improve my skills with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to make the application and website a great visual experience for users. These things will take time and effort to learn. Alternatively, I could outsource these specific tasks to a team of people and oversee the project instead of doing every part myself.
</p>
<p>With the release of my application and website, “Do It Now!” I hope that it can encourage as many people as possible to be more productive in their lives and complete their goals. By Gamifying the tasks that we usually procrastinate, “Do It Now!” will not only improve the productivity and lives of our users but also the lives of those impacted by our users.
