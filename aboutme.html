<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My Name is Jordan Oâ€™Meara, I was born in Shepparton, Victoria in September of 1991 and have lived here most of my life. My hobbies include computers, video games, video production and skateboarding.
</p>

<p> I finished secondary school in 2009 and decided to work full-time in the food industry. In 2011 I decided to give studying a try and began a Bachelor of Arts course, but due to my work schedule and financial issues I did not complete the course.
</p>

<p>Since then I have continued to work as a Manager in the food industry and have been wanting to return to study at some point. In 2015 my Daughter, Violet, was born, so I have been quite busy with her ever since.
