<h1>My Interest in IT</h1>

<p>My Interest in IT started when I was a child, our first computer was a Compaq Presario Desktop Computer running Windows 95, and my parents could not keep me away from it. From that point on I have always had an interest in computers and how they worked.
</p>

<p>As I got older my fascination with computers continued, although as for most of my life I knew more about computers than my entire family, I had a false sense of knowledge and over time stopped learning new things.
 </p>

<p>In the IT world things change and evolve very quickly, so although I have stayed interested in IT and computers and kept up with things on a more casual basis, I am probably about a decade or more behind in my IT education.
</p>

<p>As a Kid I remember messing around with HTML and C++, however I do not think I remember any of it. I remember discovering you could open a programs files in notepad and see and change the code, and that made me feel smart and I loved it.
</p>

<p>Fast forward over 15 years later and this year I finally got around to building my first computer, something I had been planning to do since 2012. This made me reflect on my love for computers and lament the fact that I had not put any effort into studying it.
</p>

<p>I chose to study IT at RMIT because I had heard good things from past students studying other subjects both on campus and online. Ultimately though it was the timing of the course starting that got me to enrol.
</p>

<p>In this course I expect to catch up on the IT education I have missed out on over the last 2 decades and learn new and exciting things that can allow me to one day have a career in IT.
</p>

<p>Whether that is as simple as fixing computers in a computer shop or as extravagant as working for Intel or Microsoft, I believe a career in IT would be a great fit for me.
