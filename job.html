<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<p>The Position I have chosen is Head of IT at West Technology in Sydney. </p>
<p>The advertisement for this position can be found <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50566491?type=standout#searchRequestToken=445c1bf0-3c0a-4cb0-9962-986c3823ef41">here</a>

<p>This is a leadership role reporting directly to the company CEO and involves not only maintaining the IT infrastructure of the company but also communicating with other areas of the business and of course leading the rest of the IT department. I have plenty of experience in Leadership and Management and using those skills in an IT setting would allows for more job options and in this case quite a large expected rate of pay.
</p>
<p>While not listed in the advertisement I believe an IT degree would be very advantageous when applying for this position, or at the very least for getting an entry level job to gain the experience required. They also list prior IT Management experience and specifically experience in system migration and integration. This would be something that I can work towards.
</p>
<p>This is a Management position and I have worked in Management for several years so I believe this experience would be beneficial. I also have a certificate 4 in both Business and Management which I believe would be useful for this application.
I believe I am an assertive and proactive communicator and thrive in a fast-paced work environment.
</p>
<p>I believe my first step towards the skills and requirements for this position would be to successfully complete my Bachelor of IT, as well as continue my work in management to build as many skills as I can. Next, I would want to gain experience in the IT industry and work towards an IT Management position, to gain the specific IT Management experience required.
