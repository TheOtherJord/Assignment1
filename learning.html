<h1>My Learning Style</h1>
<h2>LifeTrain Learning Style Quiz</h2>

<p>The LifeTrain Learning Style Quiz tells me that my Primary Learning style, with a 42% match, is the Pragmatic Style. This is about wanting to see how what is being learned is used in the real world, liking to experiment and try things out in different ways. Examples of this is using Case studies to learn, by putting things into a real-world context. This is accurate for me as I often do not quite get things until I am able to do it myself and in my own way.
</p>

<p>My Secondary learning style according to the quiz, with a 25% match, is Theorist Style. This style is all about being logical and approaching things with rationality and objectivity. This does not quite fit for me I do not think, I do like to stick to logic, but it is not something I really consider when in a learning setting.
</p>

<p>My Tertiary learning style is Activist style, this time an 11% match. This style is all about fully immersing one’s self into the subject with brainstorming, roleplaying and group discussions. I agree with this one, I believe I am quite open-minded and flexible. I enjoy hearing other people’s views and am willing to change my views when presented with new information. I think the fact that I am sometimes rather introverted, and it can take a short while for me to get comfortable with a new group and fully get into a discussion or brainstorming session. This is something I am working to improve.
</p>

<p>My Quaternary learning style, once again with an 11% match, is Reflector style. This is where my introversion comes into play, this style is about being cautious and sitting back to analyse information and help others to reach a conclusion, often focusing more on the big picture. Although I often will dive in and go all out, I would say this approach is also quite common for me.
